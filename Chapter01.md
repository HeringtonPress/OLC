# Base Rules

OSR DnD rules compiled and adapted from Arnold K’s Goblin Laws of Gaming (GLoG).

## How to Play

Simply, the referee describes a situation, and you tell what your character would do in that context. The referee might ask you to roll a D20 and add a number from your character sheet to the result. If the total is 16 or above, your character succeeds what they intended to do. Either way, the referee describes the new situation, and so on.

## Creating a Character

- Choose or roll for your Kin. Your Kin will grant you a bonus, a drawback, and one stat you can reroll.
- Roll your Stats. 4d4 in order. You may reroll the Stat given by your Race and pick the higher result.
- Choose or roll for your Class. Gain the first template (A) and any other items and bonuses.
- Gain 1d10cp. If the entire group is level 1, all PCs also gain a blanket (1 slot) and 3 rations (1 slot).

## Leveling up

A newly created PC without any class templates is expected to be reasonably competent in most areas but not specialized in any one direction. One Last Coin is not about classes.

PCs gain experience points (XP) by looting stuff. Wages don’t count. The loot must be taken to a place of safety and divided or assigned to the PCs to become XP. Items or equipment used by the characters and not sold don’t count for XP purposes. *If a PC would recieve enough XP to level up more then once they instead cap just before the second level they would take.* Players should track a PC’s XP (the total amount of treasure they have accumulated) along with their current cash. Purely frivolous spending converts 10% of the money spent into XP.

Whenever a PC levels, increase their HP to a maximum of 20, select a class template if applicable, and select any one stat to increase the score of by 1.

| Level| XP        | HP      | Class Templates | 
| :--- | :-------: | :-----: | :-------------: |
| 1    | -         | Con -4  | 1               |
| 2    | 200       | Con -2  | 2               |
| 3    | 400       | Con     | 3               |
| 4    | 700       | Con +2  | 4               |
| +1   | +500      | +1      |                 |

At Level 4 a pc becomes a prominent figure of power within their region. *Fight death*

### Mastery

Beyond level 4, when you level up you gain 1 Mastery point. You also gain a Mastery point when you  bring a skill or a stat to +5. Once per day, you can spend Mastery points to change the result of a roll affecting any nearby ally or yourself at a rate of 1 point for +\-1 to the result.
