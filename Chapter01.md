# Base Rules

OSR DnD rules compiled and adapted from Arnold K’s Goblin Laws of Gaming (GLoG).

## How to Play

Simply, the referee describes a situation, and you tell what your character would do in that context. The referee might ask you to roll a D20 and add a number from your character sheet to the result. If the total is 16 or above, your character succeeds what they intended to do. Either way, the referee describes the new situation, and so on.

- Dying & Healing
- Inventory & Equipment

## Creating a Character

- Choose or roll for your Kin. Your Kin will grant you a bonus, a drawback, and one stat you can reroll.
- Roll your Stats. 4d4 in order. You may reroll the Stat given by your Race and pick the higher result.
- Choose or roll for your Class. Gain the first template (A) and any other items and bonuses.
- Gain 1d10cp. If the entire group is level 1, all PCs also gain a blanket (1 slot) and 3 rations (1 slot).

## Leveling up

A newly created PC without any class templates is expected to be reasonably competent in most areas but not specialized in any one direction. One Last Coin is not about classes.

PCs gain experience points (XP) by looting stuff. Wages don’t count. The loot must be taken to a place of safety and divided or assigned to the PCs to become XP. Items or equipment used by the characters and not sold don’t count for XP purposes. *If a PC would recieve enough XP to level up more then once they instead cap just before the second level they would take.* Players should track a PC’s XP (the total amount of treasure they have accumulated) along with their current cash. Purely frivolous spending converts 10% of the money spent into XP.

Whenever a PC levels, increase their HP to a maximum of 20, select a class template if applicable, and select any one stat to increase the score of by 1.

| Level| XP        | HP      | Class Templates | 
| :--- | :-------: | :-----: | :-------------: |
| 1    | -         | Con -4  | 1               |
| 2    | 200       | Con -2  | 2               |
| 3    | 400       | Con     | 3               |
| 4    | 700       | Con +2  | 4               |
| +1   | +500      | +1      |                 |

At Level 4 a pc becomes a prominent figure of power within their region. Each class will have different options on what they can work towards after reaching level 4. These function purely as suggestions and you may do whatever you and your GM find the most engaging.

Additionally once a player has reached 4th level they have unlocked the will to stave off death. Making a Charisma saving throw, the DC equal to 10+ the amount of scars you have.

### Mastery

Beyond level 4, when you level up you gain 1 Mastery point. You also gain a Mastery point when you  bring a skill or a stat to +5. Once per day, you can spend Mastery points to change the result of a roll affecting any nearby ally or yourself at a rate of 1 point for +\-1 to the result.

## Stats and Skills

**Strength** represents your physical prowess. It affects the number of things you can carry and your melee attacks.

**Dexterity** represents your balance, precision and reflexes. It affects your ranged attacks.

**Constitution** represents your health. It affects your durability and the number of scars you can bear.

**Intelligence** represents your knowledge and capacity to learn. It affects the number of skills you can have.

**Wisdom** represents your instinct and willpower. It is used to resist many spells and affects the number of spells you can know.

**Charisma** represents your personality. It is used to for social intereactions and affects the number of followers you can have.

**HP** (or Hit Points) is the amount of damage you can take before getting Wounded.

**Armor** is the amount of damage you ignore on each attack.

**Skills** can be anything (flower arrangement, rolling dices, etc). When asked to roll for an action, you can use one of your skills instead of the stat the referee tells you use if it would thematically make sense. You can have as many Skills as your Intelligence Bonus to a minimum of 1.

## Rolling

When the referee tells you to roll one stat (Strength, when climbing a cliff for example), roll a D20, add your stat bonus, and, if the total is higher than 13, you succeed.

For easy situations, the referee might have you roll higher than 10. For hard situations, 18.

A referee should only call for a roll when both success and failure have interesting consequences. Sometimes, failure only means that it takes 10 minutes to achieve the action isntead of a few seconds. Bashing a door, for example, might take moments on a success, and 10 minutes on a failure, attracting monsters to the noise.

Rolling with advantage means you roll twice and choose the best result. Disadvantage is the opposite. It happens when you have contextual advantages or obstacle (shooting from very far, attacking under water, etc).

## Combat

Turn Order: You act before the monsters, unless they have surprised you.

Your Turn: On your turn, your character can move nearby, talk, shout, drop an object or themselves, and do any other one combat action, which can be moving further.

Attacking: To attack, roll your weapons damage die plus the relavent stat bonus (Strength for melee or Dexterity for ranged) and the referee subtracts it from the target’s HP. Reducing a monster’s HP to 0 kills it.

Dodging: To avoid an attack, roll Dexterity. Rolling 20 means you get a free attack.

## Dying & Healing

Every point of damage you take below 0 HP counts as a Wound. When you gain a wound, you fall unconscious and start dying. If you reach 10 wounds, you die.

When you are dying, you must roll Constitution on each of your turns.

- On a roll of 1, your character dies.
- On a failure, you gain 1 Wound.
- On a success, nothing changes.
- On a roll of 20 or on result of 24 or higher, you stabilize and stop dying.

Up to two allies can roll Wisdom to stabilize you. Expending bandages gives advantage on that roll.

Stabilizing does not remove wounds.

**Healing**: An 8 hour rest heals all HP and stat losses, consuming 1 ration.

Medical care heals all Wounds. Medical care requires to play another character for 1 session and for the wounded character to spend this time in a safe space with healers.

## Inventory

You have a number of Inventory Slots equal to your Strength. Only items carried count towards this limit. Horses, hirelings, and carts do not count. Clothing, minor non-magical jewellery, and other cosmetic items do not take up inventory slots unless they are particularly bulky such as armour.

An inventory slot can hold an object about the size and weight of a human head. large objects can take up multiple slots where as small objects can be stacked in groups of 4 with ammunition being stackable up to 10 per slot.

It takes an action to retrieve an item, unless it is in your first 3 slots.

## Equipment

### Durability

Under certain circumstances you may be required to make a durability roll. Roll a d6 and compare it to the durability stat of the target item. if it is above the stat the item breaks.

### Melee Weapons

Improvised (wine bottle, chair) 1D4 damage, can be throw

Light (dagger, javelin) 1D6 damage, can be thrown

Medium (sword, axe) 1D8 damage, 1D10 with two hands

Heavy (greatsword, greataxe) 1D12 damage, needs two hands

Pole (spear, halberd) 1D8 damage, needs two hands, free attack if a monster charges you

### Ranged Weapons

Light (darts) 1 damage, can attack twice

Medium (sling) 1D4 damage

Heavy (bow) 1D6 damage, needs two hands

Mechanical (crossbow, musket) 1D12 damage, needs two hands, must take one action to recharge

### Armour

Armour pieces reduce damage by 1, to a minnimum of 1, but also lowers your dexterity by 1 (down to 1). You can wear 3 pieces of armour at a time; head, body, and misc.

When an attack against you rolls max damage you must make a durability roll.

**Helmet**

**Breastplate**

**Gauntlets**

**Boots**

**Pauldrons**

**Shields** Like most armour shields reduce damage taken by 1 and do not count towards your worn armour limit but do require a free hand. Additionally a shield can be sundered. Breaking the shield but reducing the incoming damage of one attack by a d12 instead of 1.
