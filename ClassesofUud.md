**A:** Grit, Parry

**B:** Notches, +1 attack per round

**C:** Campaigner

You can have as many Scars as your WIL without them taking inventory slots.

### A: Parry

Once per day you can reduce incoming damage by 1d12 points. If you also choose to sunder your shield, you can reduce the damage by 12 points instead of 1d12

### B: Notches

Each time you attain a total of 10, 20, 30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger), you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below. Keep track of your kills and special abilities on the back of your character sheet.

- +1 Damage
- Expanded critical range (+1)
- Special ability (negotiat with GM, one per weapon).
Examples: ability to draw the weapon from any slot, knock a target prone on a critical, wield a two-handed weapon in one hand, gain a bonus to use the weapon as a tool, etc.

For example, a Fighter with 50 flail kills (4 notches) could have +1 damage, a critical range of (1-3), and the ability to stun an opponent for one round on a critical hit. The GM decides what counts as a kill.

### C: Campaigner

Armor occupies 2 fewer item slots in your inventory. Example: chain occupies 0 slots instead of 2.
	
### D: Cleave

## Wizard

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>

**Starting Equipment**: A strange hat, ink and quill, a spellbook.

**Starting Skills**: University Graduat, Alchemist, Charlatan, or Heretical Recluse.

For every Wizard template you gain, you gain one extra **Spell Die** (SD) and you can study without spending a treasure **Study**.

### Spells

Wizards get a random one for free at level 1. They’re stored in your Psyche and you spend Spell Dice to cast them.

<details><summary>How spells work</summary>
<p>

Spell Dice (SD)
You get 1 per Wizard template. They are D6s.

Whenever you cast a spell, you choose how many SD to invest into it. The result of the spell depends on the number of [dice] and their [sum].

If a SD rolls a 1, 2 or 3, you don’t lose it. Otherwise, you lose it until you get a night of sleep. You can’t cast without SD.

Every time you roll doubles you get closer to Catastrophe.

**Catastrophe**
Every time you roll doubles you gain 1 Doom Point. Roll a D20. If you roll equal to or below your doom score, you trigger a catastrophe. These might end your wizardly career.

### Study

You need a Spellbook to study. You cannot take a Wizard template if you do not possess a Spellbook. When you study, you choose which book you are studying, gain the knowledge contained in it and roll for one of its spells. If you already know the spell, roll again.
