<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>

**Starting Equipment**: Dagger, Tattered cloak, 4 candles, a momento you are unwilling to part with.

**Starting Skill**: 

**A:** Spirit Casting, Funeral Rite, +2 Spells (1d4)

**B:** Tether, +1 Spells (1d6)

**C:** +1 Spells (1d6)

**D:** Deadly Preminition, +2 Spells (choice)

For every Deathtouched template you have, you gain one extra Spirit Die (SD) 

### A: Spirit Casting

Exploding dice: The die has burned up and does not enter your pool of expended dice.

### A: Funeral Rite

Spend 10 minutes performing a funeral rite on a corpse you saw die. Invest any number of expent SD returning them to your pool on a 1-3. Mishaps and exploding dice still apply.

### B: Tether

Select a willing party member. Over the course of a day you form a spiritual tether to them binding your souls together. You can spend a day unteathering from someone wether they're are willing or not. 

When your tether takes damage and you can see them you may remove half the damage from them applying it to yourself. When you take damage if you can see your Tether you can remove half your damage recieved and apply it to them.

The damage that gets halved is after acounting for Resistance and when splitting it the second person does not get to apply their resistance.

If your Tether dies it triggers a catastropy.

### D: Deadly Preminition

Once per day you can reroll a number of SD equal to the number of deathtouched templates you have. You must take the new roll.

### Who Are You?

### Spells

1. **Spectral Hand**

R:10' T:point D:[sum] minutes

Create a spectral floating hand that can manipulate items within range. It is intangible when you want it to be. You can have multiple hands active at once. For each die, you can increase the size of the hand and step up the damage of its unarmed attacks.

2. **Ice Knife**
  
R:50' T:creature D:0
  
Target takes [sum] damage. Adjacent creatures take [dice] damage.

3. **Levitate**
  
R:50' T:creature, object D:concentration
  
You will an object to raise, lower, or hover. You cannot move the object horizontally, and you cannot move it more than 10' per turn. Maximum weight is[dice]x500 lbs. Lasts as long as you concentrate, but you take 1d6 psychic damage per round after [dice]x3 rounds.

4. **Disguise**
  
R:touch T:person, object D:[dice] hours

You cloak the object in illusion, making it appear as another object of the same type. An apple could be disguised as any other type of fruit; a table could be disguised as any other type of furniture. A humanoid can be disguised as any other humanoid of comparable size. This only extends to the visual properties of the object. The maximum size of the object depends on how many dice are invested in the spell: 1 [dice]: human-sized, 2 [dice]: ogre- or wagon-sized, 3 [dice]: dragon- or tavern-sized, [dice]: ship- or bridge-sized.

5. **Animate Object**
 
R:touch T:[sum] objects D:[sum] minutes

Targets become 1HD creatures that can move under their own power. Make Charisma tests to command them. They're about as smart as a trained dog, and can talk.

6. **Gaseous Form**

R:self/touch T:creature D:[sum] minutes

You become a roughly-humanoid conglomeration of spectral gas. You have [dice] of the substance's useful properties of your choice (e.g. flight, transparency, intangibility, etc.), and your unarmed attacks deal a relevant damage type, stepped up once for each die beyond the first. You are weak to anything the substance is weak to, and are always crit by those damage types.

7. **Blight**

R:touch T:creature, object D:0

Targets take [sum] necrotic damage, and show physical signs of aging (-[dice] STR/DEX/CON, counts as a wound). Objects are aged by [sum] days [1D]/months [2D]/years [3D]/decades [4D].

8. **Contact Great Spirit**

R:self T: D:1 hour

For the duration, you enter a trance and commune with a powerful spirit. You may ask it [dice] questions. It will answer them to the best of its ability (though cryptically), then require a favor. That favor will be proportionate to the implications of answering your question. You cannot cast this spell again until you have fulfilled your end of the bargain.
