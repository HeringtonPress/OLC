## Sorcerer

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
**Starting Equipment**: Outlandish Costume, 

**Starting Skill (+5)**: Your choice of Party Tricks, Arson, Theater, or Con Artist.

**A:** Soul Casting, 1 Ambient Sorcery

**B:** Billowing Robes

**C:** Soul Vision

**D:** Magic Ward

For every Sorcerer template you have, you gain one SD.
  
### A: Soul Casting

You alter the world through sheer force of will. You need no charms, no runes, no spells, no incantations. Reality is yours to
command.

To change the world, select an ability (Alter, Create, or Harm) and a number of Sorcerer Dice (SD) you wish to invest, roll them, and add the numbers together. As a Sorcerer, you get +1 SD per Sorcerer template. Some effects depend on the number of [dice] invested and the [sum] they show. Doubles, triples and quadruples result in Calamities.

SD can be used any number of times per day. Unlike a wizard’s MD, they always return to your pool. Each time you use your sorcerous powers past the first time per day, add +1 ID (Instability Die) to your pool. These dice do not count towards the [dice] and [sum] of sorcerous effects, but they do count towards doubles. Use 2 different colours of dice. Increasing the power of your sorcerous effects may also add ID.

Sorcerers don't run out of steam. They have the opposite problem.

### B: Billowing Robes

Any outlandish costume you wear grants the resistance that an armour of similar value would.

### C: Soul Vision

You can see the souls of living creatures. This allows you to guess the approximate location of invisible creatures. You can also immediately tell if a person is possessed, undead, protected by the Authority, or a spellcaster. The price for this gift is your connection to others. You permanently lose 1d6 Wisdom (as the constant scrutiny of souls warps your mind) or 1d6 Charisma (as you become callous and jaded).

### D: Magic Ward

Reduce all incoming magic damage by 2. This does not apply to self-inflicted damage. Once per day, negate a spell that targets you. This does not apply to spells generated by Calamities.

### Sorcerous Effects

**Harm**

Deal [sum]+[dice] damage to one target creature or object you can see. Creatures and magical objects can Save to negate. Flavour however you'd like: lightning bolts, beams of light, grasping hands from the underworld. It’s your soul vs. the target’s soul. Unlike your other abilities, this effect is permanent.

+1 ID for each prior sorcerous effect you've used today.

+1 ID per additional target.

**Alter**

Make a declarative statement affecting one creature or object you can see. The statement is true for [dice] rounds. The statement cannot cause damage directly (use Harm), move a creature or object, or create new objects or effects (use Create). Creatures and magical objects can Save to avoid being altered.

+1 ID for each prior sorcerous effect you've used today.

+1 ID per additional target.

+1 ID to affect an area the size of a wagon.

+2 ID to affect an area the size of a cottage.

+3 ID to affect an area the size of a village.

+1 ID to make the effect last for [dice] minutes.

+2 ID to make the effect last for [dice] hours.

+3 ID to make the effect last for [dice] days.

**Create**

Create something. The creature or object created exists for [dice] rounds. Without adding ID, the creature is person-sized or smaller and has 2 or fewer HD. Objects are person-sized or smaller.

Creatures created cannot deal damage. You can create objects with magical effects (flying carpets, invisibility cloaks), but created objects cannot deal magical damage (you can make a regular sword but not a +10 vorpal sword of fire) or or provide permanent effects (healing potions only heal for the duration listed, rings of permanent stat gain only work for the duration). You can make a sword that looks like a +10 vorpal sword of fire though.

+1 ID for each prior sorcerous effect you've used today.

+1 ID per additional object or creature created.

+2 ID to create a creature of up to +4 HD.

+1 ID to create an object the size of a wagon.

+2 ID to create an object the size of a cottage.

+3 ID to create an object the size of a village.

+1 ID to create a magical or sufficiently weird object.

+1 ID to make the creature or object last for [dice] minutes.

+2 ID to make the creature or object last for [dice] hours.

+3 ID to make the creature or object last for [dice] days.

## Deathtouched

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>

**Starting Equipment**: Dagger, Tattered cloak, 4 candles, a momento you are unwilling to part with.

**Starting Skill**: Your choice of Embalment, Last Rites, Occult,  

**A:** Spirit Casting, Funeral Rite, +2 Spells (1d4)

**B:** Tether, +1 Spells (1d6)

**C:** +1 Spells (1d6)

**D:** Deadly Preminition, +2 Spells (choice)

For every Deathtouched template you have, you gain one extra Spirit Die (SD) 

### A: Spirit Casting

Exploding dice: The die has burned up and does not enter your pool of expended dice.

### A: Funeral Rite

Spend 10 minutes performing a funeral rite on a corpse you saw die. Invest any number of expent SD returning them to your pool on a 1-3. Mishaps and exploding dice still apply.

### B: Tether

Select a willing party member. Over the course of a day you form a spiritual tether to them binding your souls together. You can spend a day unteathering from someone wether they're are willing or not. 

When your tether takes damage and you can see them you may remove half the damage from them applying it to yourself. When you take damage if you can see your Tether you can remove half your damage recieved and apply it to them.

The damage that gets halved is after acounting for Resistance and when splitting it the second person does not get to apply their resistance.

If your Tether dies it triggers a catastropy.

### D: Deadly Preminition

Once per day you can reroll a number of SD equal to the number of deathtouched templates you have. You must take the new roll.

### Who Are You?

### Spells

1. **Spectral Hand**

R:10' T:point D:[sum] minutes

Create a spectral floating hand that can manipulate items within range. It is intangible when you want it to be. You can have multiple hands active at once. For each die, you can increase the size of the hand and step up the damage of its unarmed attacks.

2. **Ice Knife**
  
R:50' T:creature D:0
  
Target takes [sum] damage. Adjacent creatures take [dice] damage.

3. **Levitate**
  
R:50' T:creature, object D:concentration
  
You will an object to raise, lower, or hover. You cannot move the object horizontally, and you cannot move it more than 10' per turn. Maximum weight is[dice]x500 lbs. Lasts as long as you concentrate, but you take 1d6 psychic damage per round after [dice]x3 rounds.

4. **Disguise**
  
R:touch T:person, object D:[dice] hours

You cloak the object in illusion, making it appear as another object of the same type. An apple could be disguised as any other type of fruit; a table could be disguised as any other type of furniture. A humanoid can be disguised as any other humanoid of comparable size. This only extends to the visual properties of the object. The maximum size of the object depends on how many dice are invested in the spell: 1 [dice]: human-sized, 2 [dice]: ogre- or wagon-sized, 3 [dice]: dragon- or tavern-sized, [dice]: ship- or bridge-sized.

5. **Animate Object**
 
R:touch T:[sum] objects D:[sum] minutes

Targets become 1HD creatures that can move under their own power. Make Charisma tests to command them. They're about as smart as a trained dog, and can talk.

6. **Gaseous Form**

R:self/touch T:creature D:[sum] minutes

You become a roughly-humanoid conglomeration of spectral gas. You have [dice] of the substance's useful properties of your choice (e.g. flight, transparency, intangibility, etc.), and your unarmed attacks deal a relevant damage type, stepped up once for each die beyond the first. You are weak to anything the substance is weak to, and are always crit by those damage types.

7. **Blight**

R:touch T:creature, object D:0

Targets take [sum] necrotic damage, and show physical signs of aging (-[dice] STR/DEX/CON, counts as a wound). Objects are aged by [sum] days [1D]/months [2D]/years [3D]/decades [4D].

8. **Contact Great Spirit**

R:self T: D:1 hour

For the duration, you enter a trance and commune with a powerful spirit. You may ask it [dice] questions. It will answer them to the best of its ability (though cryptically), then require a favor. That favor will be proportionate to the implications of answering your question. You cannot cast this spell again until you have fulfilled your end of the bargain.
