**Starting Equipment**: a walking stick and a piece of practical-but-unique headwear.

### Tricks
  
Every time you gain a Sennex template, roll 1d12 and gain that Trick. If you roll a repeat, take your choice of the one above or below it.
	
Tricks take up a Psyche slot but the material components of them always seem to be on hand without taking up an inventory slot.

### A: Well-Learned

For each Sennex template you posses you may have a skill not take up a Psyche slot.

### A: Ancient Tongues

When you encounter some bit of language that you don’t know—like a page in a book, inscription on a ring, or occult chanted phrase—there’s a 2-in-6 chance you know it. Not that you know the whole language, just that you happen to know what this particular bit of language means. 

As you gain templates in this class, the chances that you know any particular bit of language increases by 1-in-6 per template.

### B: Unanswered Questions
  
You have a stat called Unanswered, which starts at 0. Everytime you encounter something very strange and mysterious and unknown in your adventuring, add 1 to your Unanswered stat. Note that this has to be stuff that is really weird and unexplained, not minor stuff. 

Good examples of unanswered questions include:

  1. What is through the Red Iron Door under Mount Breakspear?
  2. Who is the hooded figure we keep seeing at dusk and dawn?
  3. Why would our friend, the Duke of Ravenwood, suddenly turn on us?
  4. What happened that caused the ruined castle to the east to split in half?
  5. Where can we find the lair of the demonghast called Fatemonger?
  6. What does this mysterious serrated amulet do, and how do you use it?

Big, bad questions, ones with reaching implications and strange answers. Again, whenever you have a new question, write it down, and then add 1 to your Unanswered stat.

When you are in the presence of a great deal of knowledge—which might be a big library, another sage or scholar, some ancient wise being, or something else entirely—roll 1d6. If the result is less than or equal to your Unanswered stat, you learn the answer to one of your big questions, and then reduce your Unanswered stat by the amount rolled. This can be related to the source of knowledge you’re dealing with, or it could just be a flash of inspiration; how you piece the info together matters less than that you now know it.

It’s important to note that if you discover an answer to one of your big questions organically, just through playing the game, that doesn’t reduce your Unanswered stat. You only reduce your Unanswered stat when you specifically use your Senex ability to divine answers in this way.

### C: Deep Insight

If you spend a minute or so watching someone, you can make 3 Swords checks. For each success you learn one of the following three things; what their next immediate course of action is, why they’re taking that particular course of action, and how you could best change their mind. Once you’ve done this, you can’t do it again until tomorrow, and you can’t do it to the same person two days in a row.

An example of this could be “the King is going to banish us from the realm,” and “he’s doing it because he’s already unpopular with his subjects, and news of war from the South would spark further unrest,” and “he fears for his own throne, but if we can protect his throne he’ll be happy to keep us around.”

### D: Hidden Speech
  
When you succeed on the now 4-in-6 roll to use Ancient Tongues, you now have enough of that language to carry on a medium-length conversation fluently. 

Furthermore, you can now use Ancient Tongues (and thus Hidden Speech) on things that might not ordinarily qualify as languages: the call of wild animals, the whispering of trees, the crash of a thunderstorm, the clink of gold coins, the creak of an old castle, or the cry of the oppressed. 

### Tricks
For each Senex template you take, you roll 1d12 and gain one of these; if you roll a repeat, take your choice of the option above or below it.

  1. **Flask**. You always have a small flask of alcohol on you, no matter what, and when you or a party member really need a slug, it’s always got just enough.
  2. **Voice**. You are very good at doing imitations and mimicry, to an uncanny degree.
  3. **Animal**. You’ve got a small animal with you, like a raven or a cat, that is cleverer than normal, can read whatever you can, and will sometimes do what you tell it to do.
  4. **Quill**. You’ve got a quill (or a knife, if you’d rather be etching than writing) that can write on anything—wood, stone, metal, whatever. 
  5. **Light**. You can touch a small object to make it glow like a candle; you get 1 hour of this per template per day.
  6. **Notebook**. You have a notebook on your person that never leaves your side. Literally. If someone takes it away from you, it’ll end up back on your person, somehow.
  7. **Cowl**. When you wear your practical headgear, you can choose to have it hide your face from all but dedicated scrutiny; you’ll just look like an old person, and people will quickly write you off.
  8. **Tea**. You’re just really bonkers good at making tea, and know tons about it; if you claim it’s magical, anyone and everyone will believe you.
  9. **Fire**. You can start a small fire with almost anything under almost any conditions. 
  10. **Staff**. Your walking stick will never break, and you have advantage on checks against being deprived of it (which includes stuff like Háma at the door to the Golden Hall).
  11. **Charm**. People just seem to take a shine to you when they first meet you, especially animals, children, and elders.
  12. **Mouth**. You can whistle clearly and loudly, blow ornate smoke-shapes, and tie knots with your tongue.
