## Hunter

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
**Starting Equipment**: bow, 40 arrows, dagger, leather armour.

**Starting Skill (+5)**: Tracking and your choice of Foraging, Maps, or Beasts. 

**A:** Crippling Shot, Quick Shot 

**B:** Wilderness Sense

**C:** Monster Chef

**D:** Vanish

You can collect enough food in a location with sufficient flora/fauna equal to the number of Hunter templates you have. Food collected this way cannot be presserved and must be consumed the day you collected it.

### A: Crippling Shot

If you hit an enemy with a ranged weapon, you can choose to deal 1 damage instead of rolling for damage. The next attack made by the enemy deals 1⁄2 normal damage.

### A: Quick Shot

If you do not move on your turn you may make an additional attack with a ranged weapon. Your first attack must have been made with the same weapon.

If using a crossbow or other weapon requiring 1 or more rounds to reload, take only one shot, but ignore the reload time.

### B: Wilderness Sense

After the GM gives you the Omen for an encounter, you can choose to reroll the encounter and get a different Omen. You must accept the new result. You have a 50% chance to act in surprise rounds.

### C: Monster Chef

You’ve learned to prepare and preserve monsters that you’ve hunted before (you must keep track of this). Rations created this way provide an additional 1d4 HP.

Make an INT Save to tell if a new monster will be outright poisonous to eat. You can also make an educated guess about the extra effects of consuming magical creatures.

### D: Vanish

If you are in dense forests, hills, caves, or other terrain with abundant line-of-sight-blocking features, you can choose to vanish. While vanished, you cannot affect the world or be affected by it. This ability is limited by plausibility. You can reappear at any time by climbing down a tree, walking over a hill, emerging from a shrub, etc.

## Barbarian

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
Starting Equipment: heavy weapon, leather armour.

Starting Skill: Foreign Parts. Also, roll on the following table.

**A:** Rage

**B:** Danger Sense, A Taste of Home, +1 Stealth

**C:** Feat of Strength, Die Hard

**D:** Tough

You gain +2 HP for each Barbarian template you possess.

### A: Rage

You can choose to enter a rage at the start of your turn, or in response to taking damage. You might froth, or stare in battlefocus, or merely let a facade drop and give in to your ancient urges, brutal warrior training, or religious fanaticism.

While in a rage:

- You gain +4 to Wisdom for Initiative purposes. You act before all other PCs in a round.
- You gain +1 attack per round.
- All your melee attacks inflict +1 damage.
- You can only cast damaging spells. All your spells deal +2 damage (if single target) or +1 damage (if multiple targets).
- You are immune to pain and fear.
- You cannot do anything defensive, curative, or tactical with your allies. All you can do is attempt to kill things.
- You cannot stop fighting until you kill, subdue, or drive off all enemies. If an ally has injured you this fight, they count as an enemy.

To stop raging, Make a Wisdom Save at the start of your turn.

### B: Danger Sense

If you are surprised, you have a 50% chance to act in the surprise round anyway. If you encounter a creature no one in the group has seen before, you can roll under Intelligence to remember a detail or weakness, provided the creature is not unique.

### B: A Taste of Home

You can consume a special ration to regain 1d6+1 HP. This takes 1 round. Roll on the Table of Barbarian Delicacies. One “dose” costs 1gp and can be purchased in any trading city. 3 doses fit in a single inventory slot. You cannot eat while raging, but you can immediately enter a rage after eating the ration. If you have any Lethal Damage, you instead heal to 0 HP. If an ally waves the ration under you nose, you can roll under Constitution to wake up.

### C: Feat of Strength

Once per day, you have 22 Strength for 1 round. Your Strength bonus is +4.

### C: Die Hard

You have 4 rounds instead of 3 to remove all your Fatal Wounds.

### D: Tough

Reduce all incoming damage by 1 point. Gain +2 to Saves vs. Mind Altering Effects, including your save to end a Rage. 

### Who Are You?

You are from Foreign Parts. The language of people Around Here is strange to you; their customs are sometimes amusing and sometimes disgusting. You might worship the Authority as they do, but you might be from a heretical sect or cult. You are a probably a member of the Third Estate or an Outlaw. You carry your own law and customs.

## Knight

<details><summary>Open</summary>
<p>
  
**Starting Equipment**: chainmail, shield, sword, horse, 5sp.

**Starting Skill (+1)**: "Courtesy" and your choice of "Poetry", "Military" and "Inquisition".

**A:** Challenge, Champion

**B:** Bodyguard

**C:** Dragon Slayer, Parry

**D:** Aura of Courage, Inspire

You gain +2 to Save vs Fear for each Knight template you possess. 

### A: Challenge

This ability only works on creatures that can understand you and are capable of being offended. If you challenge a creature outside combat, they must Save or accept your challenge. In civilized areas, this could mean a duel, a joust, or a brawl. The challenged party can set conditions for the duel. Leaders may send out champions.

In combat, you can challenge one creature each turn as a free action. The creature must Save. If they fail they must attack you. This ability cannot force an enemy to make major tactical errors.

### A: Champion

After all enemies have completed their turns in a combat round, select one enemy that only targeted you with attacks, and that you targeted with your attack. Make a second attack against that enemy. Effectively, this gives you two attacks per round if you are fighting an enemy one-on-one.

### B: Bodyguard

Once per round, if an adjacent ally would take damage from a physical attack, you may make an Attack roll. If you succeed, you take the damage instead.

### C: Dragon Slayer

Once per day, you may add +X damage to one of your physical attacks, where X is the HD of the most powerful monster killed by you or your party. Keep track of this. If you miss, this ability is not expended.

### C: Parry

Once per day you can reduce incoming damage by 1d12 points. If you also choose to sunder your shield, you can reduce the damage by 12 points instead of 1d12.

### D: Aura of Courage

Allies who can see and hear you can use your Save vs Fear instead of their own. This ability has no effect if you are currently afraid.

### D: Inspire

Once per day, allies who can see and hear you heal 1d4 HP. If they were at full HP, they instead gain +2 to their next Attack roll.

### Who Are You?

You are a member of the Second Estate, an armour-clad warrior on horseback. Knights from Around Here are universally male or must appear as male. Anything goes in Foreign Parts. You lend legitimacy to any group. You may be granted titles, gifts of land, or castles. Everyone else has to work furiously to get into your social class. People respect you.

If you are from Around Here your weapon of choice is the sword and you ride a horse. In Foreign Parts, knights might use bows and ride lizards, but Foreign Parts are disreputable.

Honour and chivalry are ideals often disregarded in practice.

### The Second Estate

Your starting Noble Rank is 1. Your expenses are 12gp/month. Roll on the table below to see how you are supported.

The highest rank you can possibly inherit is 1d6+2. This might be your father’s uncle’s title or something equally remote. This might require divine intervention, a plague, or a most dreadful amount of killing. If you are a bastard, you cannot inherit unless you are legitimized by a higher noble (usually a King).

| 1d3 | Knightly Support |     | 
| :-: | :--------------- | :-- | 
| 1   | Large Farm | You hold a prosperous farm and a minor title. You have 1d6 tenants (total, not families), a small house, and no prestige. The farm pays 12gp per month. |
| 2   | Dubious Stipend | Your family is prosperous, but you are a minor son of a minor branch. Your stipend pays 12gp per month, but each month roll 1d10. On a 10 it stops forever. |
| 3   | No Support | You are a knight without land or support. There is a 50% chance you are a bastard. If you fail to pay your expenses you will drop out of the Second Estate. |

|      | Heraldry Generator  |                    |                     |
| :--: | :------------------ | :----------------- | :------------------ |
| **1d10** | **Field (Base Colour)** | **Division (Overlay)** | **Charge (Decoration)** |
| 1    | Argent (Silver) | Fess (Top/Bottom) | Escutcheon (Shield) |
| 2    | Or (Gold) | Pale (Left/Right) | Lozenge (Diamond) |
| 3    | Azure (Blue) | Bend (Diagonal S) | Roundel (Circle) |
| 4    | Gules (Red) | Bend Sinister (Diag. Z) | Billet (Vert. Rectangle) |
| 5    | Very (Green) | Saltire (Quart. X) | Mullet (Star) |
| 6    | Indigo | Cross (Quart. + | Crescent (Moon) |
| 7    | Vilette (Violet) | Chevron (Half ^) | Cross |
| 8    | Sable (Black) | Pall (Split Y) | Angel |
| 9    | Sanguine (Blood) | Wavy (Half ~) | Lion |
| 10   | Tenne (Tawny) | Dancetty (Half ^^^^^) | Sword |

Roll at least once for Field. If 1 or 2 is rolled, next result must be 3-8. Roll once for Division, designating sections as different Field colours. Roll 1d4 times for Charges, with 1d4 copies of each charge. Muck around with the idea a bit. This generator will infuriate students of heraldry. Deal with it.
