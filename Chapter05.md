## Death and Dismemberment Table

### Death and Dismemberment

Roll 1d12+ Lethal Damage + Number of Current Injuries

The effects are cumulative. If a PC with -8 HP and no current Injuries rolls a 10 on a d12, to the leg, X = 10+8+0 = 18. They gain 4 Fatal Wounds, the leg is Mangled, and also Disabled for 18 days.

If they took a further 1 point of damage (-9 HP), they would roll 1d12 + 9 (Lethal Damage) + 1 (Mangled) + 1 (Disabled) for 1d12+11.

If required, roll 1d6 for hit location.
