## Death and Dismemberment Table

### Death and Dismemberment

Roll 1d12+ Lethal Damage + Number of Current Injuries

The effects are cumulative. If a PC with -8 HP and no current Injuries rolls a 10 on a d12, to the leg, X = 10+8+0 = 18. They gain 4 Fatal Wounds, the leg is Mangled, and also Disabled for 18 days.

If they took a further 1 point of damage (-9 HP), they would roll 1d12 + 9 (Lethal Damage) + 1 (Mangled) + 1 (Disabled) for 1d12+11.

If required, roll 1d6 for hit location.

### Fatal Wounds

A PC has 3 rounds to clear all their Fatal Wounds or they die. They can attempt to remove a Fatal Wound on their turn by rolling 1 on a d6. PCs with Fatal Wounds are unconscious. This does not mean they are quiet or asleep (they can be screaming and holding a stump), but it means they cannot take conscious or deliberate actions. Remove oldest Fatal Wounds first. You may want to use different coloured d6s to represent Fatal Wounds acquired on different rounds.

Up to two adjacent allies can try to remove Fatal Wounds from a dying character by spending their turn doctoring the wounded PC and then rolling Intelligence.
