# Chapter 2: Characters


## Creating a Character

- Choose or roll for your Kin. Your Kin will grant you a bonus, a drawback, and one stat you can reroll.
- Roll your Stats. 4d4 in order. You may reroll the Stat given by your Race and pick the higher result.
- Choose or roll for your Class. Gain the first template (A) and any other items and bonuses.
- Roll for any skills or items requested by your class.
- Gain 1d10cp. If the entire group is level 1, all PCs also gain a blanket (1 slot) and 3 rations (1 slot).

## The Base Adventurer

A newly created PC without any class templates is expected to be reasonably competent in most areas but not specialized in any one direction. One Last Coin is not about classes. Classes are just your hammer not the whole toolbelt. Classes are significantly less important than what you do around the table.

## Classes Overview

### Ultra-Core Classes

The basic, balanced, and entirely sensible classes. Suitable for new players, uncertain players, small groups, or a more grounded setting.

- [Fighter](Chapter03.md#Fighter)
- [Thief](Chapter03.md#Thief)
- [Wizard](Chapter03.md#Wizard) ([Orthodox](Chapter03.md#Orthodox-Wizard))

### Core Classes

The classes listed here are the classics! Functional alone and in any imaginable combination with eachother. Excelent for any circumstance without getting to gonzo while still making sure each one holds it's own charm.

- [Fighter](Chapter03.md#Fighter)
- [Barbarian](Chapter03.md#Barbarian)
- [Knight](Chapter03.md#Knight)
- [Thief](Chapter03.md#Thief)
- [Hunter](Chapter03.md#Hunter)
- [Monk](Chapter03.md#Monk)
- [Wizard](Chapter03.md#Wizard)
- [Sorcerer](Chapter03.md#Sorcerer)
- [Summoner](Chapter03.md#Summoner)

### Novelty Classes

The classes listed here require unusual playstyles, GM adjudication, or a specific kind of setting.

- [Cannoneer](Chapter03.md#Cannoneer)
- [Exorcist](Chapter03.md#Exorcist)
- [Homunculator](Chapter03.md#Homunculator)
- [Inventor Necromancer](Chapter03.md#Inventor-Necromancer)
- [Goblin](Chapter03.md#Goblin)
- [Many Goblins](Chapter03.md#Many-Goblins)

### Extra

Extra classes cannot be taken as a first template. They are odd, obscure, and strange.

- [Surly Gnome](Chapter03.md#Surly-Gnome)

## Templates & Multiclassing

Each class has 4 Templates. Templates are gained sequentially (A, then B, then C, then D). To multiclass, simply pick the lowest template from another class. E.g. A level 4 character could pick Fighter A, Wizard A, Monk A, and Fighter B. Multiclassing should make sense. Multiclassing for optimization or mechanical reasons should be strongly discouraged by the GM. The game is not about the mechanics or having the biggest numbers. **Bigger numbers will not save you.**

## Leveling Up

PCs gain experience points (XP) by looting stuff. Wages don’t count. The loot must be taken to a place of safety and divided or assigned to the PCs to become XP. Items or equipment used by the characters and not sold don’t count for XP purposes. Players should track a PC’s XP (the total amount of treasure they have accumulated) along with their current cash. Purely frivolous spending converts 10% of the money spent into XP.

Whenever a PC levels, increase their HP, Attack, and base Save (before their Charisma bonus is added). A PC can also test to improve a stat of their choice. Declare the stat and roll 3d6. If the result is over, the stat’s value increases by 1.

| Level| XP        | HP      | Class Templates | 
| :--- | :-------: | :-----: | :-------------: |
| 1    | -         | Con -4  | 1               |
| 2    | 200       | Con -2  | 2               |
| 3    | 400       | Con     | 3               |
| 4    | 700       | Con +2  | 4               |
| 5    | 1000      | Con +4  |                 |
| 6    | 1400      | Con +6  |                 |
| 7    | 1800      | Con +7  |                 |
| 8    | 2200      | Con +8  |                 |
| 9    | 2600      | Con +9  |                 |
| 10   | 3000      | Con +10 |                 |
| +1   | +500      | +1.     |                 |

At Level 5, and every time a PC levels up past Level 5, they can retire to safety. The GM cannot torment them anymore. If they can afford it, they can buy some land, set up a shop, teach at a wizard college, or beg in the gutter. At Level 10 and beyond, a PC who dies can fight death. If they succeed, they can return to life. All future Saves to avoid death will be at a penalty, but they gain a second chance.

| Stat |  | Bonus |  | Stat |  | Bonus |  | Stat |  | Bonus |
| :--: |:-:| :---: |:-:| :--: |:-:| :---: |:-:| :--: |:-:| :---: |
| 1,2 |  | -3 |  | 9,10,11 |  | 0 |  | 18,19,20 |  | 3 |
| 3,4,5 |  | -2 |  | 12,13,14 |  | 1 |  | 21,22,23 |  | 4 |
| 6,7,8 |  | -1 |  | 15,16,17 |  | 2 |  | 24+ |  | 5 |
