# Chapter 2: Characters


## Creating a Character

- Choose or roll for your Kin. Your Kin will grant you a bonus, a drawback, and one stat you can reroll.
- Roll your Stats. 3d6 in order. You may reroll the Stat given by your Race and pick the higher result.
- Choose or roll for your Class. Gain the first template (A) and any other items and bonuses.
- Roll for any skills or items requested by your class.
- Gain 1d10cp. If the entire group is level 1, all PCs also gain a blanket (1 slot) and 3 rations (1 slot).

## The Base Adventurer

A newly created PC without any class templates is expected to be reasonably competent in most areas but not specialized in any one direction. One Last Coin is not about classes. Classes are just your hammer not the whole toolbelt. Classes are significantly less important than What You Do Around The Table.

## Classes Overview

### Ultra-Core Classes

The basic, balanced, and entirely sensible classes. Suitable for new players, uncertain players, small groups, or a more grounded setting.

- [Fighter](Chapter03.md#Fighter)
- [Thief](Chapter03.md#Thief)
- [Wizard](Chapter03.md#Wizard) ([Orthodox](Chapter03.md#Orthodox-Wizard))

### Core Classes

The classes listed here are the classics! Functional alone and in any imaginable combination with eachother. Excelent for any circumstance without getting to gonzo while still making sure each one holds it's own charm.

- [Fighter](Chapter03.md#Fighter)
- [Barbarian](Chapter03.md#Barbarian)
- [Knight](Chapter03.md#Knight)
- [Thief](Chapter03.md#Thief)
- [Hunter](Chapter03.md#Hunter)
- [Monk](Chapter03.md#Monk)
- [Wizard](Chapter03.md#Wizard)
- [Sorcerer](Chapter03.md#Sorcerer)
- [Summoner](Chapter03.md#Summoner)

### Novelty Classes

The classes listed here require unusual playstyles, GM adjudication, or a specific kind of setting.

- [Cannoneer](Chapter03.md#Cannoneer)
- [Exorcist](Chapter03.md#Exorcist)
- [Inventor Necromancer](Chapter03.md#Inventor-Necromancer)
- [Goblin](Chapter03.md#Goblin)
- [Many Goblins](Chapter03.md#Many-Goblins)

### Extra

Extra classes cannot be taken as a first template. They are odd, obscure, and strange.

- Surly Gnome
- Cannibal Gourmet
- Vampire

## Templates & Multiclassing

Each class has 4 Templates. Templates are gained sequentially (A, then B, then C, then D). To multiclass, simply pick the lowest template from another class. E.g. A level 4 character could pick Fighter A, Wizard A, Monk A, and Fighter B. Multiclassing should make sense. Multiclassing for optimization or mechanical reasons should be strongly discouraged by the GM. The game is not about the mechanics or having the biggest numbers. **Bigger numbers will not save you.**
