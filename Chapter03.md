# Chapter 3: Classes


## Fighter

Starting Equpment: leather armour, sword, bow, 20 arrows.

Starting Skill: Roll on the following table.

**A:** Parry, +1 attack per round

**B:** Notches

**C:** Quick Learner, +2 Attack Bonus

**D:** Impress, Cleave

You gain +1 HP for each Fighter template you possess.

### A: Parry

Once per day you can reduce incoming damage by 1d12 points. If you also choose to sunder your shield, you can reduce the damage by 12 points instead of 1d12.

### B: Notches

Each time you attain a total of 10, 20, 30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger), you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below. Keep track of your kills and special abilities on the back of your character sheet.

- +1 Damage
- Expanded critical range (+1)
- Special ability (negotiat with GM, one per weapon).
Examples: ability to draw the weapon from any slot, knock a target prone on a critical, wield a two-handed weapon in one hand, gain a bonus to use the weapon as a tool, etc.

For example, a Fighter with 50 �ail kills (4 notches) could have +1 damage, a critical range of (1-3), and the ability to stun an opponent for one round on a critical hit. The GM decides what counts as a kill.

### C: Quick Learner

You can become proficient with a new weapon after 4 successful hits (instead of 8). On a critical hit, you immediately become proficient.

### D: Impress

Whenever you win a fight against challenging foes, people who don't like you make a new reaction roll with a +4 bonus. This even works on people you just defeated in combat, unless you caused them undeserved or disproportionate harm. Hirelings get a +2 to Morale or a new Save vs Fear.

### D: Cleave

Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 HP with an attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a target within 5’. You can only cleave an number of targets equal to your Level in a single round.

## Barbarian

Starting Equpment: heavy weapon, leather armour.

Starting Skill: Foreign Parts. Also, roll on the following table.

**A:** Rage

**B:** Danger Sense, A Taste of Home, +1 Stealth

**C:** Feat of Strength, Die Hard

**D:** Tough

You gain +2 HP for each Barbarian template you possess.

### A: Rage

You can choose to enter a rage at the start of your turn, or in response to taking damage. You might froth, or stare in battlefocus, or merely let a facade drop and give in to your ancient urges, brutal warrior training, or religious fanaticism.

While in a rage:

- You gain +4 to Wisdom for Initiative purposes. You act before all other PCs in a round.
- You gain +1 attack per round.
- All your melee attacks inflict +1 damage.
- You can only cast damaging spells. All your spells deal +2 damage (if single target) or +1 damage (if multiple targets).
- You are immune to pain and fear.
- You cannot do anything defensive, curative, or tactical with your allies. All you can do is attempt to kill things.
- You cannot stop fighting until you kill, subdue, or drive off all enemies. If an ally has injured you this fight, they count as an enemy.

To stop raging, Make a Wisdom Save at the start of your turn.

### B: Danger Sense

If you are surprised, you have a 50% chance to act in the surprise round anyway. If you encounter a creature no one in the group has seen before, you can roll under Intelligence to remember a detail or weakness, provided the creature is not unique.

### B: A Taste of Home

You can consume a special ration to regain 1d6+1 HP. This takes 1 round. Roll on the Table of Barbarian Delicacies. One “dose” costs 1gp and can be purchased in any trading city. 3 doses fit in a single inventory slot. You cannot eat while raging, but you can immediately enter a rage after eating the ration. If you have any Lethal Damage, you instead heal to 0 HP. If an ally waves the ration under you nose, you can roll under Constitution to wake up.

### C: Feat of Strength

Once per day, you have 22 Strength for 1 round. Your Strength bonus is +4.

### C: Die Hard

You have 4 rounds instead of 3 to remove all your Fatal Wounds.

### D: Tough

Reduce all incoming damage by 1 point. Gain +2 to Saves vs. Mind Altering Effects, including your save to end a Rage.
