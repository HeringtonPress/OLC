# Chapter 3: Classes


## Fighter

Starting Equpment: leather armour, sword, bow, 20 arrows

Starting Skill: Roll on the following table

**A:** Parry, +1 attack per round

**B:** Notches

**C:** Quick Learner, +2 Attack Bonus

**D:** Impress, Cleave

You gain +1 HP for each Fighter template you possess.

### A: Parry

Once per day you can reduce incoming damage by 1d12 points. If you also choose to sunder your shield, you can reduce the damage by 12 points instead of 1d12.

### B: Notches

Each time you attain a total of 10, 20, 30, and 50 kills with a weapon type (such as 10 kills with a dagger), you unlock a new ability for that weapon, chosen from the list below. Keep track of your kills and special abilities on the back of your character sheet.

- +1 Damage
- Expanded critical range (+1)
- Special ability (negotiat with GM, one per weapon).
Examples: ability to draw the weapon from any slot, knock a target prone on a critical, wield a two-handed weapon in one hand, gain a bonus to use the weapon as a tool, etc.

For example, a Fighter with 50 �ail kills (4 notches) could have +1 damage, a critical range of (1-3), and the ability to stun an opponent for one round on a critical hit. The GM decides what counts as a kill.

### C: Quick Learner

You can become proficient with a new weapon after 4 successful hits (instead of 8). On a critical hit, you immediately become proficient.

### D: Impress

Whenever you win a fight against challenging foes, people who don't like you make a new reaction roll with a +4 bonus. This even works on people you just defeated in combat, unless you caused them undeserved or disproportionate harm. Hirelings get a +2 to Morale or a new Save vs Fear.

### D: Cleave

Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 HP with an attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a target within 5’. You can only cleave an number of targets equal to your Level in a single round.
