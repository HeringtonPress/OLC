**D:** Tough

You gain +2 HP for each Barbarian template you possess.

### A: Rage

You can choose to enter a rage at the start of your turn, or in response to taking damage. You might froth, or stare in battlefocus, or merely let a facade drop and give in to your ancient urges, brutal warrior training, or religious fanaticism.

- You gain +1 attack per round.

- You can only cast damaging spells. All your spells deal +2 damage (if single target) or +1 damage (if multiple targets).
- You are immune to pain and fear.
- You cannot do anything defensive, curative, or tactical with your allies. All you can do is attempt to kill things.
- You cannot stop fighting until you kill, subdue, or drive off all enemies. If an ally has injured you this fight, they count as an enemy.

To stop raging, Make a Wisdom Save at the start of your turn.

### B: Danger Sense

If you are surprised, you have a 50% chance to act in the surprise round anyway. If you encounter a creature no one in the group has seen before, you can roll under Intelligence to remember a detail or weakness, provided the creature is not unique.

One “dose” costs 1gp and can be purchased in any trading city. 3 doses fit in a single inventory slot. You cannot eat while raging, but you can immediately enter a rage after eating the ration. If you have any Lethal Damage, you instead heal to 0 HP. If an ally waves the ration under you nose, you can roll under Constitution to wake up.

### C: Feat of Strength

Once per day, you have 22 Strength for 1 round. Your Strength bonus is +4.

### C: Die Hard

You have 4 rounds instead of 3 to remove all your Fatal Wounds.

### D: Tough

Reduce all incoming damage by 1 point. Gain +2 to Saves vs. Mind Altering Effects, including your save to end a Rage. 

### Who Are You?

You are from Foreign Parts. The language of people Around Here is strange to you; their customs are sometimes amusing and sometimes disgusting. You might worship the Authority as they do, but you might be from a heretical sect or cult. You are a probably a member of the Third Estate or an Outlaw. You carry your own law and customs.

## Knight

Starting Equpment: chainmail, shield, sword, horse, 5sp.

Starting Skill: Courtesy. Also, roll on the following table.

**A:** Challenge, Champion

**B:** Bodyguard

**C:** Dragon Slayer, Parry

**D:** Aura of Courage, Inspire

You gain +2 to Save vs Fear for each Knight template you possess. 

### A: Challenge

This ability only works on creatures that can understand you and are capable of being offended. If you challenge a creature outside combat, they must Save or accept your challenge. In civilized areas, this could mean a duel, a joust, or a brawl. The challenged party can set conditions for the duel. Leaders may send out champions.

In combat, you can challenge one creature each turn as a free action. The creature must Save. If they fail they must attack you. This ability cannot force an enemy to make major tactical errors.

### A: Champion

After all enemies have completed their turns in a combat round, select one enemy that only targeted you with attacks, and that you targeted with your attack. Make a second attack against that enemy. Effectively, this gives you two attacks per round if you are fighting an enemy one-on-one.

### B: Bodyguard

Once per round, if an adjacent ally would take damage from a physical attack, you may make an Attack roll. If you succeed, you take the damage instead.

### C: Dragon Slayer

Once per day, you may add +X damage to one of your physical attacks, where X is the HD of the most powerful monster killed by you or your party. Keep track of this. If you miss, this ability is not expended.

### C: Parry

Once per day you can reduce incoming damage by 1d12 points. If you also choose to sunder your shield, you can reduce the damage by 12 points instead of 1d12.

### D: Aura of Courage

Allies who can see and hear you can use your Save vs Fear instead of their own. This ability has no effect if you are currently afraid.

### D: Inspire

Once per day, allies who can see and hear you heal 1d4 HP. If they were at full HP, they instead gain +2 to their next Attack roll.

### Who Are You?

You are a member of the Second Estate, an armour-clad warrior on horseback. Knights from Around Here are universally male or must appear as male. Anything goes in Foreign Parts. You lend legitimacy to any group. You may be granted titles, gifts of land, or castles. Everyone else has to work furiously to get into your social class. People respect you.

If you are from Around Here your weapon of choice is the sword and you ride a horse. In Foreign Parts, knights might use bows and ride lizards, but Foreign Parts are disreputable.

Honour and chivalry are ideals often disregarded in practice.

### The Second Estate

Your starting Noble Rank is 1. Your expenses are 12gp/month. Roll on the table below to see how you are supported.

The highest rank you can possibly inherit is 1d6+2. This might be your father’s uncle’s title or something equally remote. This might require divine intervention, a plague, or a most dreadful amount of killing. If you are a bastard, you cannot inherit unless you are legitimized by a higher noble (usually a King).

| 1d3 | Knightly Support |     | 
| :-: | :--------------- | :-- | 
| 1   | Large Farm | You hold a prosperous farm and a minor title. You have 1d6 tenants (total, not families), a small house, and no prestige. The farm pays 12gp per month. |
| 2   | Dubious Stipend | Your family is prosperous, but you are a minor son of a minor branch. Your stipend pays 12gp per month, but each month roll 1d10. On a 10 it stops forever. |
| 3   | No Support | You are a knight without land or support. There is a 50% chance you are a bastard. If you fail to pay your expenses you will drop out of the Second Estate. |

|      | Heraldry Generator  |                    |                     |
| :--: | :------------------ | :----------------- | :------------------ |
| **1d10** | **Field (Base Colour)** | **Division (Overlay)** | **Charge (Decoration)** |
| 1    | Argent (Silver) | Fess (Top/Bottom) | Escutcheon (Shield) |
| 2    | Or (Gold) | Pale (Left/Right) | Lozenge (Diamond) |
| 3    | Azure (Blue) | Bend (Diagonal S) | Roundel (Circle) |
| 4    | Gules (Red) | Bend Sinister (Diag. Z) | Billet (Vert. Rectangle) |
| 5    | Very (Green) | Saltire (Quart. X) | Mullet (Star) |
| 6    | Indigo | Cross (Quart. + | Crescent (Moon) |
| 7    | Vilette (Violet) | Chevron (Half ^) | Cross |
| 8    | Sable (Black) | Pall (Split Y) | Angel |
| 9    | Sanguine (Blood) | Wavy (Half ~) | Lion |
| 10   | Tenne (Tawny) | Dancetty (Half ^^^^^) | Sword |

Roll at least once for Field. If 1 or 2 is rolled, next result must be 3-8. Roll once for Division, designating sections as different Field colours. Roll 1d4 times for Charges, with 1d4 copies of each charge. Muck around with the idea a bit. This generator will infuriate students of heraldry. Deal with it.

## Sorcerer

Starting Equpment: Outlandish Costume worth 1sp

Starting Skill: Foreign Parts

**A:** +1SD, Soul Casting, 1 Ambient Sorcery

**B:** +1SD, Billowing Robes

**C:** +1SD, Soul Vision

**D:** +1SD, Magic Ward

Bonus

### A: Soul Casting

You alter the world through sheer force of will. You need no charms, no runes, no spells, no incantations. Reality is yours to
command.

To change the world, select an ability (Alter, Create, or Harm) and a number of Sorcerer Dice (SD) you wish to invest, roll them, and add the numbers together. As a Sorcerer, you get +1 SD per Sorcerer template. Some effects depend on the number of [dice] invested and the [sum] they show. Doubles, triples and quadruples result in Calamities.

SD can be used any number of times per day. Unlike a wizard’s MD, they always return to your pool. Each time you use your sorcerous powers past the �rst time per day, add +1 ID (Instability Die) to your pool. These dice do not count towards the [dice] and [sum] of sorcerous effects, but they do count towards doubles. Use 2 different colours of dice. Increasing the power of your sorcerous effects may also add ID.

Sorcerers don't run out of steam. They have the opposite problem.

### B: Billowing Robes

If you are wearing an outlandish costume worth at least 10gp, your armour counts as Leather. If you are wearing an outlandish costume worth at least 100gp, your armour counts as Chain. If you are wearing an outlandish costume worth at least 1,000gp, your armour counts as Plate.

### C: Soul Vision

You can see the souls of living creatures. This allows you to guess the approximate location of invisible creatures. You can also immediately tell if a person is possessed, undead, protected by the Authority, or a spellcaster. The price for this gift is your connection to others. You permanently lose 1d6 Wisdom (as the constant scrutiny of souls warps your mind) or 1d6 Charisma (as you become callous and jaded).

### D: Magic Ward

Reduce all incoming magic damage by 2. This does not apply to self-inflicted damage. Once per day, negate a spell that targets you. This does not apply to spells generated by Calamities.

### Who Are You?

Your pride, sense of self, and sheer bloody-mindedness override reality. You brook no master or competition; there can be only one sorcerer in any given party, city, cabal, or cult. To the feudal system, you are an Outlaw. To the Church, you are an appalling spectacle, and should be put in your place (or in the ground) before you harm anyone else.You might be tempted to optimize your Sorcerous Powers, but consider... is that what a poweraddled, overconfident, and utterly self-assured sorcerer would do? Would they do the best thing or the coolest thing?

### Sorcerous Effects

**Harm**

Deal [sum]+[dice] damage to one target creature or object you can see. Creatures and magical objects can Save to negate. Flavour however you'd like: lightning bolts, beams of light, grasping hands from the underworld. It’s your soul vs. the target’s soul. Unlike your other abilities, this effect is permanent.

+1 ID for each prior sorcerous effect you've used today.

+1 ID per additional target.

**Alter**

Make a declarative statement affecting one creature or object you can see. The statement is true for [dice] rounds. The statement cannot cause damage directly (use Harm), move a creature or object, or create new objects or effects (use Create). Creatures and magical objects can Save to avoid being altered.

+1 ID for each prior sorcerous effect you've used today.

+1 ID per additional target.

+1 ID to affect an area the size of a wagon.

+2 ID to affect an area the size of a cottage.

+3 ID to affect an area the size of a village.

+1 ID to make the effect last for [dice] minutes.

+2 ID to make the effect last for [dice] hours.

+3 ID to make the effect last for [dice] days.

**Create**

Create something. The creature or object created exists for [dice] rounds. Without adding ID, the creature is person-sized or smaller and has 2 or fewer HD. Objects are person-sized or smaller.

Creatures created cannot deal damage. You can create objects with magical effects (flying carpets, invisibility cloaks), but created objects cannot deal magical damage (you can make a regular sword but not a +10 vorpal sword of fire) or or provide permanent effects (healing potions only heal for the duration listed, rings of permanent stat gain only work for the duration). You can make a sword that looks like a +10 vorpal sword of fire though.

+1 ID for each prior sorcerous effect you've used today.

+1 ID per additional object or creature created.

+2 ID to create a creature of up to +4 HD.

+1 ID to create an object the size of a wagon.

+2 ID to create an object the size of a cottage.

+3 ID to create an object the size of a village.

+1 ID to create a magical or suf�ciently weird object.

+1 ID to make the creature or object last for [dice] minutes.

+2 ID to make the creature or object last for [dice] hours.

+3 ID to make the creature or object last for [dice] days.

## Many Goblins

Many Goblins act as one character. There are a lot of them (though the exact amount seems to vary from scene to scene) and they contribute about as much as one actual character (at best). They are a bunch of goblins milling about in the back of the scene, doing goblin things, kind of half-paying attention, and mostly serving as colourful detail.

Starting Equpment: many daggers, filthy rags, fleas, ect. Roll for one random item from the Table of Proffesions.

Starting Skill: goblan.

**A:** Shared Totals

**B:** +1 Goblin Warlord

**C:** +1 Goblin Warlord, Use Thing

**D:** +1 Goblin Warlord, New Thing

Many Goblins gain +2 HP every level. If this would take them over 20 HP, they instead split into Two Many Goblins and lose half their maximum HP. One half runs away.

### A: Shared Totals

Many Goblins have a shared HP pool just like a normal character. Every point of damage causes a single goblin to die in an inconsequential background sort of way. Area of affect attacks and traps only affect them once. Single-target Save or Die effects instead cause Many Goblins to lose 1 HP. Other single-target spells usually affect all the goblins. Mutations might affect all the goblins or become a Thing they can use (see Use Thing below).

Somehow they consume the same ration as one person.

If Many Goblins are reduced to 0 HP, they become strewn about the place, wounded and moaning, miserable and unable to help anyone until healed. If they are reduced below 0 HP they all die in a suitably tragic-comic fashion. The only survivors will be the Goblin Warlords (see below).

Many Goblins have 5 inventory slots total. They can carry more things but they will inevitably lose, smash, ruin, sell, or eat all but 5 items. Weapons and armour are carried separately and do not occupy inventory slots. In order to gain any benefit from a weapon, armour set, or magic item, Many Goblins need 10 copies. Give them 10 swords and they deal sword damage, etc. They spend money collectively and irresponsibly.

If you need to determine exactly how Many Goblins are present, roll 1d12+6. This number varies encounter to encounter and even round to round. When performing basic unskilled labour, like digging a trench or carrying buckets, Many Goblins count as 10 people for the �rst hour, 5 people the next hour, and give up after the third hour. They occupy an area 20' square whenever possible, spreading as needed (a 5' wide 80' long line, etc.)

### B: Goblin Warlord

One goblin in the swarm has earned a name. Once per encounter, for one round, the named goblin can do something different than the other Many Goblins. They could run to warn the PCs while the rest of the Many Goblins fight something. At the end of the round, the Goblin Warlord is absorbed back into the swarm. Goblin Warlords get a name and a very short description like, "has a horned helmet" or "smells of cheese."

If the Many Goblins die, each Goblin Warlord becomes a Level 1 Goblan with no bonuses, the stats of the Many Goblans, and 2 HP. If the Goblin Warlords find some more goblins, or spend some time in an area where goblins are likely to be found, they can recombine to form a new Level 2 Many Goblans. Only 1 Goblin Warlord survives this process. You can use orphans, urchins, drunkards, wastrels, and particularly cunning feral dogs to fill out the ranks. Goblinism is contagious.

### C: Use Thing

Many Goblins can now be given magic items or special tools. They can use them once per encounter, collectively. This could be a Goblin Warlord action. The goblin with the magic wand fires it, the goblin with the serrated weasel-thrower uses it, then steps back into the crowd.

### D: New Thing

Many Goblins gain a special 6th inventory slot that contains a random item rolled on the Table of Professions. Roll the item randomly each encounter. If the Many Goblins run into another room or out of sight (one round at least) and then run back (a second round) they can reroll the item.
