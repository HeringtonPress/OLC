## Sorcerer

Starting Equpment: Outlandish Costume worth 1sp

Starting Skill: Foreign Parts

**A:** +1SD, Soul Casting, 1 Ambient Sorcery

**B:** +1SD, Billowing Robes

**C:** +1SD, Soul Vision

**D:** +1SD, Magic Ward

Bonus

### A: Soul Casting

You alter the world through sheer force of will. You need no charms, no runes, no spells, no incantations. Reality is yours to
command.

To change the world, select an ability (Alter, Create, or Harm) and a number of Sorcerer Dice (SD) you wish to invest, roll them, and add the numbers together. As a Sorcerer, you get +1 SD per Sorcerer template. Some effects depend on the number of [dice] invested and the [sum] they show. Doubles, triples and quadruples result in Calamities.

SD can be used any number of times per day. Unlike a wizard’s MD, they always return to your pool. Each time you use your sorcerous powers past the �rst time per day, add +1 ID (Instability Die) to your pool. These dice do not count towards the [dice] and [sum] of sorcerous effects, but they do count towards doubles. Use 2 different colours of dice. Increasing the power of your sorcerous effects may also add ID.

Sorcerers don't run out of steam. They have the opposite problem.

### B: Billowing Robes

If you are wearing an outlandish costume worth at least 10gp, your armour counts as Leather. If you are wearing an outlandish costume worth at least 100gp, your armour counts as Chain. If you are wearing an outlandish costume worth at least 1,000gp, your armour counts as Plate.

### C: Soul Vision

You can see the souls of living creatures. This allows you to guess the approximate location of invisible creatures. You can also immediately tell if a person is possessed, undead, protected by the Authority, or a spellcaster. The price for this gift is your connection to others. You permanently lose 1d6 Wisdom (as the constant scrutiny of souls warps your mind) or 1d6 Charisma (as you become callous and jaded).

### D: Magic Ward

Reduce all incoming magic damage by 2. This does not apply to self-inflicted damage. Once per day, negate a spell that targets you. This does not apply to spells generated by Calamities.

### Who Are You?

Your pride, sense of self, and sheer bloody-mindedness override reality. You brook no master or competition; there can be only one sorcerer in any given party, city, cabal, or cult. To the feudal system, you are an Outlaw. To the Church, you are an appalling spectacle, and should be put in your place (or in the ground) before you harm anyone else.You might be tempted to optimize your Sorcerous Powers, but consider... is that what a poweraddled, overconfident, and utterly self-assured sorcerer would do? Would they do the best thing or the coolest thing?

### Sorcerous Effects

**Harm**

Deal [sum]+[dice] damage to one target creature or object you can see. Creatures and magical objects can Save to negate. Flavour however you'd like: lightning bolts, beams of light, grasping hands from the underworld. It’s your soul vs. the target’s soul. Unlike your other abilities, this effect is permanent.

+1 ID for each prior sorcerous effect you've used today.

+1 ID per additional target.

**Alter**

Make a declarative statement affecting one creature or object you can see. The statement is true for [dice] rounds. The statement cannot cause damage directly (use Harm), move a creature or object, or create new objects or effects (use Create). Creatures and magical objects can Save to avoid being altered.

+1 ID for each prior sorcerous effect you've used today.

+1 ID per additional target.

+1 ID to affect an area the size of a wagon.

+2 ID to affect an area the size of a cottage.

+3 ID to affect an area the size of a village.

+1 ID to make the effect last for [dice] minutes.

+2 ID to make the effect last for [dice] hours.

+3 ID to make the effect last for [dice] days.

**Create**

Create something. The creature or object created exists for [dice] rounds. Without adding ID, the creature is person-sized or smaller and has 2 or fewer HD. Objects are person-sized or smaller.

Creatures created cannot deal damage. You can create objects with magical effects (flying carpets, invisibility cloaks), but created objects cannot deal magical damage (you can make a regular sword but not a +10 vorpal sword of fire) or or provide permanent effects (healing potions only heal for the duration listed, rings of permanent stat gain only work for the duration). You can make a sword that looks like a +10 vorpal sword of fire though.

+1 ID for each prior sorcerous effect you've used today.

+1 ID per additional object or creature created.

+2 ID to create a creature of up to +4 HD.

+1 ID to create an object the size of a wagon.

+2 ID to create an object the size of a cottage.

+3 ID to create an object the size of a village.

+1 ID to create a magical or suf�ciently weird object.

+1 ID to make the creature or object last for [dice] minutes.

+2 ID to make the creature or object last for [dice] hours.

+3 ID to make the creature or object last for [dice] days.
